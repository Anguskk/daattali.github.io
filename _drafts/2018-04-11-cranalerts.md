Have you ever found yourself asking "how can I make sure I don't miss the next version release of package X"?

That's the exact problem I set out to solve with [CRANalerts](https://cranalerts.com/). With [CRANalerts](https://cranalerts.com/) you simply provide your email address and an R package name, confirm your email address, and then every time the package gets updated on CRAN, you'll get notified.

shiny app
need a designer
show what it loked like with css
be helpful (show error emssages, look great and be easy to use on mobile, tell users "did you mean X" because of auto capitalize on mobile, submit on Enter
